Multi-omics (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq),analysis, and machine learning to dissect CD48 regulation and function as par of the paper entitled "CD48 at the Nexus of NK‐Cell Immunity and Exhaustion in Multiple Myeloma". In human MM and Vk*MYC mice scRNA‐seq datasets, NK cells exhibit stepwise increases in inflammatory and exhaustion signatures and loss of cytotoxic potential as disease progresses.

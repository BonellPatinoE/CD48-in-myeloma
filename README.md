Multi-omics (bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq), genome-wide CRISPR-KO/a screens, and machine learning to dissect CD48 regulation and function. In human MM and Vk*MYC mice scRNA‚Äêseq datasets, NK cells exhibit stepwise increases in inflammatory and exhaustion signatures and loss of cytotoxic potential as disease progresses.
